<H1>Create and Query an DynamoDB Table<h2>
<h2>About this Hands-On Activity</h2>

After you complete the instructions on this page, you will be able to do the following: Create and launch a DynamoDB table- Creating a table includes choosing a partition key and an optional sort key. Unlike what we have been working with in the RDS universe, this database will be schemaless so we won't need to specify much more than a table name and a primary key.

In this activity, you will learn how to create a simple table, add data, scan, and query the data, delete data, and delete the table by using theÂ DynamoDB console. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that supports both document and key-value store models. Its flexible data model, reliable performance, and automatic scaling of throughput capacity make it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications.
